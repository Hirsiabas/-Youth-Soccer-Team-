This database was designed to manage a youth soccer team by organizing players, matches, training sessions, attendance, performance, coaches, and parents. Each table has a primary key to uniquely identify records and uses foreign keys to establish relationships, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval. The **Players** table is central, linking to **Attendance**, **Performance**, and **Parents** tables. **Matches** and **TrainingSessions** tables store schedule details, while **Attendance** tracks player presence. **Performance** records capture individual player statistics per match. The **Coaches** and **Parents** tables store contact and role information. Throughout the project, designing the relationships and understanding foreign key constraints was challenging. Additionally, I faced difficulties using GitHub and uploading files. Creating the EER diagram in MySQL Workbench was also a learning experience, but it helped me visualize the database structure clearly.
